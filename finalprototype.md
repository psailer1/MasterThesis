# Final Prototype

In this file the Final Prototype is described. The Final Prototype is implemented with the procedure of Scenario 2 and is considered for the local execution on one device. It used the protocol HTTPS, which means secure communication is possible between the components of the CPS.

## Architecture

DA VIELLEICHT EIN BILD WO MAN DIE GLÃœHBRINE UND SO AUCH SIEHT!!! LIMITS AUFSCHREIBEN WANN SICH WAS EINSCHALTET UND ABSCHALTET. 

The figure shows the procedure within the CPS between the components.

Procedure of the Final Prototype: 

* Step 1: C2 measures the temperature of the physical environment at a given time interval. 
* Step 2: C2 checks if the temperature is above the predefined limit. If it is above, this implementation continues with Step 3, else it goes back to Step 1.
* Step 3: C2 sends a request to Orechstration System to find a suitable AC. 
* Step 4: The Orchestration System forwards the request to the SR.
* Step 5: The Service Requistry System searches the database for suitable actuators and sends information about C1 back to the Orchestration System.
* Step 6: The Orchestration System asks the Authorization System if they are allowed to communicate with each other. 
* Step 7: The Authorization System searches the existing authorization rules and reports back whether an authorization exists or not.
* Step 8: The Orchestration System then sends the communication endpoint of C1 to C2.
* Step 9: C2 sends the current temperature to C1.
* Step 10: C1 cools down the phyiscal environment.


The sequence diagram below shows a more detailed procedure, by showing which services are called by which component. Furthermore it includes the database, which stores the data, and C0, with which it is possible to start the run in CPS. Since C0 and the database have no influence on the scenario itself, they are not shown in the previous figure.

## Implementation

### Workload Balancer (C0)

As mentioned in the previous section, C0 is used to start the runs. C0 is a workload balancer to ensure that all use cases can be compared with each other in a controlled way. The workload balancer is used to define runs, which specify how many measurements should be taken per run. As MIT 4.0 is used to explore security and performance, this allows both aspects to be analysed. 

To measure the Final Prototype, the workload must first be defined and executed. The workload controller connects to C2 and send a request to the orchestration system, as shown in the first figure. The rest of the process can be found in the section [Architecture](#architecture). 

### Maven Project

The Arrowhead Framework is implemented in Java as a Maven Project, which uses the Spring Boot Framework and the Model-View-Control (MVC) Design Pattern. This means that the three core systems are implemented as a RESTful web application with web services that can be accessed in this Use Case 1 with HTTPS. For more detailed information to Arrowhead, please go to the official [Arrowhead Github Repository](https://github.com/arrowhead-f/core-java-spring). 

As mentioned in the [Master Branch](https://github.com/igo3r/MIT4.0) in all Use Cases only the three core systems are used. To add the components C1, C2 and C0 the the Arrowhead Maven Project, for each component a Java Maven Module Project have been created. To use the components within the project the pom.xml file has to be updated like shown in the figure below: 

![pom.xml File Final Prototype](/images/mavenfinalprototype.png)

As shown in the figure three lines (32-34) are added to integrate the newly created Maven Module Projects to the Arrowhead root package (core).
In the code base following names where selected: 
* arrowhead-client = Workload-Balancer C0
* arrowhead-consumer = Air Condition System C1
* arrowhead-producer = Temperater Sensor C2

### Class Diagram 

In this section a Class Diagram is shown, which indicates how the Controller Classes of the components uses their services to implement Use Case 2:

* C1 Controller uses *airConditioningService* which is called **turn_aircondition_on**: This component is waiting to be called by C2 to cool down the phyiscal environment, if the authorization rules allow the communication. 
* C2 Controller uses *temperatureMeasurementService* which is called **get_temperature**: This is the Component with which the interactin of a run starts. In this Use Case C2 measures the temperature and checks whether the predefined limit of 25 degrees has been reached. It measures as long as the temperature is above this limit. If this happens, C2 consumes the *orchestrationProcess* to lookup for C1 to cool down the room. 
* OrchestratorController uses *orchestrationProcess*: This action is called each time a component of a CPS is looking for another component or service. Therefore the request is forwarded to the Service Registry for looking up all registered systems and their services. Only if the requested service is registered, the next step is to check the authorization rules by consuming *checkAuthorizationIntraCloudRequest* service. If communication is allowed the Orechstration System return the endpoint data, so the requesting component can consume the requested service. 
* ServiceRegistryController uses *queryRegistry*: This service is used to search in the database for existing systems and services. This service is called during the *orchestrationProcess* to find the requested system and its service(s). 
* AuthorizationController uses *checkAutroizationIntraCloudRequest*: This serives is used to look for authorization rules to determine if two components are allowed to communicate with each other. This services is called during the *orchestrationProcess* to check, whether the requesting compontent and the requested component (in this case C1 and C2) are allowed to interact with each other.
