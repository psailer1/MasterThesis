## Quick Start Guide

### Docker

Placeholder

### Compile source code and manually install MySQL and Maven.
#### Requirements

The project has the following dependencies:
* JRE/JDK 11 [Download from here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html)
* Maven 3.5+ [Download from here](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) | [Install guide](https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac)
* MySQL server 5.7+ (other SQL databases can work with Hibernate ORM, but the `common module pom.xml` has to include the appropriate connector 
dependency to use them)

Verify that you have Java (```java -version```), Maven (```mvn -version```), MySQL installed properly!

Pull this code and enter the directory. 
```git clone https://github.com/arrowhead-f/core-java-spring.git```

Run the MySQL script which is in the ```scripts``` folder. If you won't run this script first, the project won't build. 

```cd core-java-spring```

Execute ```mvn install``` command. Wait until the build succeeds. 
This command builds all available projects. <br />

After succeeding enter the scripts folder and execute ```start_core_systems.sh``` or ```start_core_systems.bat``` depending on your operating system.
- serviceregistry/target directory.
```cd serviceregistry/target``` <br />and execute: ```java -jar arrowhead-serviceregistry-4.1.3.jar```
- authorization/target directory. ```cd authorization/target``` <br />and execute: ```java -jar arrowhead-authorization-4.1.3.jar``` 
- orchestrator/target directory. ```orchestrator/target``` <br />and execute: ```java -jar arrowhead-orchestrator-4.1.3.jar```


Wait until servers start...

Service Registry will be available on ```localhost:8443``` <br />
Authorization will be available on ```localhost:8445``` <br />
Orchestrator will be available on ```localhost:8441``` <br />
Event Handler will be available on ```localhost:8455``` <br />
Gatekeeper will be available on ```localhost:8449``` <br />
Gateway will be available on ```localhost:8453``` <br />

Swagger with API documentation is available in the root route.

#### Insecure Mode - (not recommended)

To start in insecure mode, you have to change the __server.ssl.enabled__ property to false. You'll have to do it for each core system, under the path target/application.properties. Note that if you recompile after the changes, the target/application.properties file will be overwritten by the default ones in the src/main/resources/application.properties.

The Gatekeeper and Gateway use encryption based on the certificates, hence there is no way to start the Gatekeeper and Gateway in insecure mode. But you can use the local cloud without these core systems. All you have to do is to set __gatekeeper\_is\_present=false__ in the application.properties of the ochestrator, and start the script __start\_coresystems\_local.bat__ or __start\_coresystems_local.sh__ depending on your operating system.

## Migration Guide 4.1.2 -> 4.1.3

4.1.3 is NOT backwards compatible with 4.1.2! Earlier it was redundant and contained gaps. Now the database and the endpoints are redesigned, they are clean, more logical and easier to use.

You can migrate your existing database manually. See the [Quick Start Guide](#quickstart), how to deploy the Core Systems.

Major endpoint changes:<br />

### Service Registry Core System:

The following endpoints no longer exist, instead use the ones on the right:

 * `PUT /mgmt/services` -> `POST /serviceregistry/mgmt/services`
 * `PUT /mgmt/systems` -> `POST /serviceregistry/mgmt/systems`
 * `GET /serviceregistry/mgmt/systemId/{systemId}` -> `GET /serviceregistry/mgmt/systems/{id}`
 * `GET /serviceregistry/mgmt/serviceId/{serviceId}/providers`
 * `PUT /serviceregistry/mgmt/query` -> `POST /serviceregistry/query`
 * `PUT /serviceregistry/mgmt/subscriptions/{id}`
 * `PUT /serviceregistry/support/remove` -> `DELETE /serviceregistry/unregister`
 * `DELETE /serviceregistry/mgmt/all`
 
 
 * __serviceregistry/register__ - data structure changed
 
Old payload, which is no longer usable
 ```json
{
  "providedService" : {
    "serviceDefinition" : "IndoorTemperature",
    "interfaces" : [ "JSON", "XML" ],
    "serviceMetadata" : {
      "unit" : "celsius"
    }
  },
  "provider" : {
    "systemName" : "InsecureTemperatureSensor",
    "address" : "192.168.0.2",
    "port" : 8080
  },
  "serviceURI" : "temperature",
  "version" : 1,
  "udp" : false,
  "ttl" : 0
} 
 ```

New payload - you can easily map the old fields to the new ones.
 ```json
{
  "serviceDefinition": "IndoorTemperature",
  "providerSystem": {
  "systemName": "InsecureTemperatureSensor",
  "address": "192.168.0.2",
  "port": 8080,
  "authenticationInfo": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni..."
 },
  "serviceUri": "temperature",
  "endOfValidity": "2019-12-05T12:00:00",
  "secure": "TOKEN",
  "metadata": {
    "unit": "celsius"
 },
  "version": 1,
  "interfaces": [
    "HTTP-SECURE-JSON"
 ]
}
```
 
### Authorization Core System:
 * __/mgmt/intracloud__ - data structure changed
 * __/mgmt/intercloud__ - data structure changed
 
### Orchestration Core System:
 Store based orchestration is available for now.
 * __/mgmt/store__ - data structure changed

## System Design Description Overview

This System provides the database, which stores information related to the currently actively offered Services within the Local Cloud.

The purpose of this System is therefore to allow:
-	Application Systems to register what Services they offer at the moment, making this announcement available to other Application Systems on the network. 
-	They are also allowed to remove or update their entries when it is necessary. 
-	All Application Systems can utilize the lookup functionality of the Registry to find Public Core System Service offerings in the network, otherwise the Orchestrator has to be used. 

However, it is worth noting, that within this generation the lookup functionality of Services is integrated within the “orchestration process”. Therefore, in the primary scenario, when an Application System is looking for a Service to consume, it shall ask the Orchestrator System via the Orchestration Service to locate one or more suitable Service Providers and help establish the connection based on metadata submitted in the request. Direct lookups from Application Systems within the network is not advised in this generation, due to security reasons.

However, the lookup of other Application Systems and Services directly is not within the primary use, since access will not be given without the Authorization JWT (JSON Web Token). The use of the TokenGeneration is restricted to the Orchestrator for general System accountability reasons. 

<a name="serviceregistry_usecases" />

## Services and Use Cases

This System only provides one Core Service the __Service Discovery__

There are two use case scenarios connected to the Service Registry. 
-	Service registration, de-registration
-	Service Registry querying (lookup)

The __register__ method is used to register services. The services will contain various metadata as well as a physical endpoint. 
The various parameters are representing the endpoint information that should be registered.

The __unregister__ method is used to unregister service instances that were previously registered in the Registry. 
The instance parameter is representing the endpoint information that should be removed.

The __query__ method is used to find and translate a symbolic service name into a physical endpoint, for example an IP address and a port.
The query parameter is used to request a subset of all the registered services fulfilling the demand of the user of the service.
The returned listing contains service endpoints that have been fulfilling the query.


There is another functionality that does not bound to any Services, just an internal part of the Service Registry. There are two optional cleanup tasks within the Service Registry, which can be used to remove old, inactive service offerings. The first task is based on pinging the service provider and if the provider does not respond to the ping, its offered services will be deleted. The second task is based on a feature, called “Time to Live”. Service providers upon registration can provide a timestamp called “end_of_validity” number, which specifies how long the service will be offered by the provider, making the service de-registrations unnecessary, if this task is active. The task is used to remove expired services. The third task is using a feature called "Heartbeat" (Not yet implemented), where the Service provider periodically signals to the Service Registry that it is still alive. When it misses it will be removed. All of these internal tasks can be configured in the application.properties file.

<a name="serviceregistry_security" />

## Security

This System can be secured via the HTTPS protocol. If it is started in secure mode, it verifies whether the Application System possesses a proper X.509 identity certificate and whether that certificate is Arrowhead compliant in its making. This certificate structure and creation guidelines ensure:
-	Application System is properly bootstrapped into the Local Cloud
-	The Application System indeed belongs to this Local Cloud
-	The Application System then automatically has the right to register its Services in the Registry.

If these criteria are met, the Application System’s registration or removal message is processed. An Application System can only delete or alter entries that contain the Application System as the Service Provider in the entry. 

<a name="serviceregistry_endpoints" />

## Endpoints

The Service Registry offers three types of endpoints. Client, Management and Private.

Swagger API documentation is available on: `https://<host>:<port>` <br />
The base URL for the requests: `http://<host>:<port>/serviceregistry`

# Authorization

<a name="authorization_sdd" />

## System Design Description Overview

This System has:
* A database that describes which Application System can consume what Services from which Application Systems (Intra-Cloud access rules)
* A database that describes which other Local Clouds are allowed to consume what Services from this Cloud (Inter-Cloud authorization rules)

The purpose of this System is therefore to:
* Provide AuthorizationControl Service (both intra- and inter-Cloud)
* Provide a TokenGeneration Service for allowing session control within the Local Cloud

The purpose of the TokenGeneration functionality is to create session control functionality through the Core Sytems. The output is  [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io) that validates the Service Consumer system when it will try to access the Service from another Application System (Service Provider). This Token shall be primarily generated during the orchestration process and only released to the Service Consumer when all affected Core Systems are notified and agreed to the to-be-established Service connection. 

This System (in line with all core Systems) utilizes the X.509 certificate Common Name naming convention in order to work. 

<a name="authorization_usecases" />

## Services and Use Cases

This System only provides two Core Services: 
* AuthorizationControl
* TokenGeneration

There are two use cases connected to the Authorization System:
* Check access rights (invoke the AuthorizationControl)
* Generate an access token (the Orchestrator invokes the TokenGeneration)

![Authorization Cross check](/documentation/images/authorization_crosscheck.png)
Figure 1. Authorization crosscheck during orchestration process

<a name="authorization_service_description_overview" />

## Service Description Overview

The AuthorizationControl Service provides 2 different interfaces to look up authorization rights:
* Intra-Cloud authorization: defines an authorization right between a consumer and provider system in the same Local Cloud for a specific Service.
* Inter-Cloud authorization: defines an authorization right for an external Cloud to consume a specific Service from the Local Cloud.

<a name="authorization_endpoints" />

## Endpoints 

The Authorization offers three types of endpoints. Client, Management and Private.

Swagger API documentation is available on: `https://<host>:<port>` <br />
The base URL for the requests: `http://<host>:<port>/authorization`

<a name="authorization_endpoints_client" />   

### Client endpoint description <br />

| Function | URL subpath | Method | Input | Output |
| -------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| [Echo](#authorization_endpoints_get_echo)     | /echo       | GET    | -     | OK     |  
| [Get Public Key](#authorization_endpoints__get_publickey) | /publickey | GET | - | [Public Key](#datastructures_publickey) |

<a name="authorization_endpoints_private />

### Private endpoint description <br />
        
These services can only be used by other core services, therefore they are not part of the public API.        
        
| Function | URL subpath | Method | Input | Output |
| -------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | ------ |

<a name="authorization_removed" />

### Removed Endpoints <br />

The following services no longer exist:
* `GET /authorization/mgmt/intracloud/systemId/{systemId}/services`
* `GET /authorization/mgmt/intracloud/systemId/{systemId}`
* `GET /authorization/mgmt/intracloud/servicedef/{serviceDefinition}`
